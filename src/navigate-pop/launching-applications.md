## Launching Applications

Applications can be launched from the Dock, the Launcher, the Applications menu, and the Terminal.

### Using the Launcher

Press the `SUPER` key or the Show Launcher icon to bring up the Launcher. <!--TODO: link to dedicated Launcher section-->

![Show Launcher](/images/locate-launch-applications/show-launcher.png)

Search for the name of the application. The Launcher will display currently running instances of that application first. Select the top result to focus the currently running instance of the application.

To run a new instance of a currently running application, use the the `ðŸ ‘` `ðŸ “` keys or mouse left-click to select the application.

You can pin additional applications to the Dock by right-clicking the application's icon in the Applications menu and selecting `Pin to Dash`.

![Add to Favorites](/images/locate-launch-applications/add-to-favorites.png)

Remove applications from the Dock by right-clicking the application and selecting `Remove from Favorites`.

### Alt + F2 & the Terminal

If you know the application's executable name, you can launch the application with a single command using `Alt` + `F2` or by typing it into a Terminal window. Note that an application's executable name is not always the application name in lower-case as shown below. Unlike the Launcher, these options will not accept the name of the app in any form besides the executable name.

#### Using Alt + F2

Press `Alt` + `F2` to bring up a command entry window. Enter the name of the application's executable and press `Enter`.

#### Using the Terminal

Launch the Terminal from the Dock or by pressing `SUPER` + `T`, then type the name of the application's executable and hit `Enter`.

# Viewing & Sorting Options in Nautilus

Users can change file icon size and sort files alphabetically, by modification date, file size, and type.

- List view: Orders files and folders into columns and rows with sortable headers.
- Grid view: Orders files and folders into an array of icons.

Toggle between List and Grid view using the icon in the upper right corner.

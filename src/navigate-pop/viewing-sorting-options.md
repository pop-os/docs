# Viewing & Sorting Options in Nautilus

Change file icon size and sort files alphabetically, by modification date, by file size, or by type.

- **List view**: Orders files and folders into columns and rows with sortable headers.
- **Grid view**: Orders files and folders into an array of icons.

Toggle between List and Grid view using the icon in the upper right corner.

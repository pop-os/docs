# Navigate Files and Folders

Pop!\_OS uses a file manager called Nautilus to graphically browse files and folders stored on the system and in connected cloud storage accounts. In Linux, a user's data is stored in their Home directory by default.

## The Home Directory

In Linux, each user account is provisioned with their own `/home` folder. This is where data from regular user activities will accumulate. A user's Home directory contains these common folders:

- Desktop
- Documents
- Downloads
- Music
- Pictures
- Public
- Templates
- Videos

## Using Nautilus to Find Your Files

Pop!\_OS uses the Nautilus file manager to provide a graphical interface for navigating folders (also called directories).

Click the file icon on the Dock to launch the Nautilus file manager.

## Using Search

Click the magnifying glass icon to search within the current directory, and any sub-folders below the current directory.

Enter a search term; matched items will automatically populate below the search bar.

Click the down arrow next to the magnifying glass and select an item under `What`. This will limit the search to that specific file type.

## General

The Primary Button performs primary actions in a graphical user interface (GUI). For right-handed users, this is usually assigned to the left mouse button.

## Mouse

| Option | Function |
|--------|----------|
| Mouse Speed | Adjust the speed of mouse cursor movement across the display when using a mouse. |
| Mouse Acceleration | Enable or disable mouse speed increasing with sustained motion in any given direction. This allows less physical movement to reach further corners of the display. |
| Natural Scrolling | Invert the direction content scrolls in response to the mouse wheel. When enabled, scrolling up on the mouse wheel pushes content toward the top of the window, moving the user's view to content lower on the page. This is similar to the movement behavior when using a touch screen. |

## Touchpad

| Option | Function |
|--------|----------|
| Touchpad | Enable or disable the touchpad. |
| Touchpad Speed | Adjust the speed of mouse cursor movement across the display when using the touchpad. |
| Disable while typing | Disable the touchpad when keyboard input is detected. |

## Touchpad Click Options

| Option | Function |
|--------|----------|
| Tap to Click | Enable single finger tap to left-click, two finger tap to right-click, and three finger tap to middle-click. |

## Touchpad Scroll & Zoom Options

| Option | Function |
|--------|----------|
| Natural Scrolling | When enabled, content is dragged in the direction of the input on the touchpad (similar to the behavior of the touch screen). |
| Two-finger Scrolling | Scroll through content by dragging two fingers along the touchpad. |
| Edge Scrolling | Scroll through content by dragging a finger along the far right edge of the touchpad. |

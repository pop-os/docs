# Setting up Printers

Most printers are plug-and-play in Pop!\_OS. Add a network or USB-connected printer in `Settings` ➞ `Printers`. Click `Add a Printer` to automatically search for any connected printers. Add a printer manually by clicking `Additional Printer Settings`.

Pop!\_OS uses the Common Unix Printing System (CUPS) print server to manage print jobs, manage print queues, and recognize connected printers. While CUPS recognizes a wide range of printer models, printer functionality may vary. Check if your printer is compatible using <a href="https://www.openprinting.org/printers" target="_blank">OpenPrinter.com</a>.

## Checking Printer Status in CUPS

CUPS can be managed directly using a web browser by navigating to the following local URL:

<a href="http://localhost:631" target="_blank">localhost:631</a>

The status window will show current print jobs, detected printers, and other information about the printing system.

### Adding Users to the lpadmin Group

CUPS allows you to manage printers using Terminal commands. A user must be a part of the `lpadmin` group to use these commands. You can confirm you are a part of this group with the following command:

```bash
groups
```

You can add yourself to this group using the below command:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG lpadmin $USER
```

If you prefer to manage printers in Terminal, See the [CUPS documentation](https://www.cups.org/doc/admin.html) for full documentation.

### Sharing a Printer to the Local Network

Share a printer with the local network by clicking the `Administration` tab.

Check the box for `Share printers connected to this system`.

Locally shared printers are visible in the `Printers` tab in the `Settings` application. Users with the appropriate group assignments can now select the printer and enter their username and password to gain access to the network printer. If a user is unable to see the printer, see the above section to confirm the user is in the `lpadmin` group, and to add the user to the group.

## HP Printers

HP printers are supported with the hplip package, which is installed by default in Pop!\_OS.

```bash
sudo apt install hplip
```

### HP Device Manager (GUI)

If you would like to use a guided GUI application from HP, you will need to install a python dependency:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-pyqt5
```

Then run `hp-setup` to start the HP Device Manager.

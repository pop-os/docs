## Does Pop!_OS Offer an LTS Version?

Pop!_OS LTS releases follows Ubuntu's LTS release schedule, with the exception that System76 only supports one LTS version of Pop!_OS until the next version is released. Note that many components of previous Pop!_OS LTS versions are still supported under Ubuntu's LTS support schedule. Also note that System76 has a very active rolling-release schedule, so end-user apps (eg. Pop Shell) often continue to receive feature updates. System76's hardware enablement (e.g. kernel & drivers) also receive feature updates.

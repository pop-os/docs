## Download the Pop!\_OS.iso File

![Linux Download ISO](/images/create-bootable-usb-linux/using-linux-download-iso.png)

Download the appropriate Pop!\_OS.iso file for your target system. See the [preparation guide](/getting-started/create-bootable-media/create-bootable-usb.html#choose-a-pop_os-image) for information about each version.

Take note of the hash value for your chosen ISO. Use this value to verify the integrity of the ISO file.

## Verify the Hash Value

1. Launch the Windows Command Prompt.

    ![Launch CMD](/images/create-bootable-usb-win10/launch-cmd.png)

2. Navigate to the folder where the Pop!\_OS.iso file is located. The user's Downloads folder is used in the below example. Substitute your username for `USERNAME`.

    ```bash
    cd C:\Users\USERNAME\Downloads
    ```

3. Use the `CertUtil` program to verify your ISO file. Make sure the name of the ISO matches exactly what is in your folder. The filename varies depending on the ISO version you chose.

    ```bash
    CertUtil -hashfile pop-os_21.10_amd64_intel_8.iso sha256
    ```

4. This command will output a long string of characters. Compare the output to the appropriate hash value on the Pop!\_OS download site.

## Create the Bootable USB

Flash your USB media with the Pop!\_OS.iso image. Note that this process will completely erase all previous data on the USB storage device.

1. Launch Etcher if it is not already running.

2. Select `Flash from file`, then navigate to and select your Pop!\_OS.iso file.

3. Click `Select target` and select your USB drive.

4. Click `Flash!`.

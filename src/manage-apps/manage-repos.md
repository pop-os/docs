# Managing Repositories

Add, remove, and edit repositories using Repoman. Repoman allows users to add Personal Package Archives (PPAs). PPAs are created by developers to distribute software not included in default repositories. Users may want to add a PPA if their software is not included in the Pop!\_Shop, or they may want to remove PPA’s after uninstalling a package.

> **Caution**: Adding PPA’s allows users to install software that has not been validated by System76 or other trusted linux repositories. PPA’s may not be vetted against packages that introduce security vulnerabilities. Users should take caution and only add PPA’s that they trust.
